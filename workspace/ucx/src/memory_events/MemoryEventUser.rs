/// A trait to use memory events.
///
/// Events are dispatched in order of callback priority (low to high).
///
/// The `result` field of a memory event is initialized to an invalid erroneous return value if the event can modify the output.
///
/// The callback is allowed to modify the fields where a mutable event is passed, and those modifications will be passed to the next callback.
/// Also, the callback is allowed to modify the `result`, but **only if it's currently invalid**.
/// A valid result indicates that a previous callback already performed the requested memory operation, so a callback should **refrain from actions with side-effects** in this case.
///
/// If the result is still invalid after all callbacks are called, the parameters, possibly modified by the callbacks, will be passed to the original handler.
