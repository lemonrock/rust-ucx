	/// In this case the corresponding UCM function needs to be invoked to trigger event handlers.
	///
	/// To take an effect, the event should be set external prior to adding event handlers for it.
	///
	/// An usage example is when the user disables UCM memory hooks (because the user has its own hooks; an example is Open MPI), but it wants to use some UCM based functionality, eg use of the IB registration cache.
	/// (The IB registration cache needs to be notified about `virtual_machine_munmap` events, therefore one adds a specific handler for it. In this case user needs to declare the `virtual_machine_munmap` event as external and explicitly call `virtual_machine_munmap()` when some memory release operation occurs).
