/// A worker is an opaque object representing the communication context.
///
/// A worker represents an instance of a local communication resource and the progress engine associated with it.
/// A progress engine is a construct that is responsible for asynchronous and independent progress of communication directives.
/// A progress engine could be implement in hardware or software.
///
/// A worker abstracts network resources such as a host channel adapter port, network interface, or multiple resources such as
/// multiple network interfaces or communication ports.
/// It can also represent virtual communication resources that are defined across multiple devices.
///
/// Although the worker can represent multiple network resources, it is associated with a single `ApplicationContext`.
///
/// All communication functions require a context to perform the operation on the dedicated hardware resource(s) and an `EndPoint` to address the destination.
///
/// NOTE: Workers are parallel 'threading points' that an upper layer may use to optimize concurrent communications.
