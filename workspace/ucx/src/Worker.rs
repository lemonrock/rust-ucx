		Creating end points.
		
		- We need to be able to send, out-of-band, `OurRemotelyAccessibleWorkerAddress` and `OurRemotelyAccessibleMemoryAddress` objects.
		- We need to be able to have an up-to-date view of all of these in our cluster.
		- A cluster should have a name.
		- A cluster runs on a fabric.
		- We will be sharing the fabric with others, potentially.
		
		- Idea:-
			- What we want is effectively a LVQ or etcd like configuration
			- Multicast DNS or Broadcast DNS (we just send every second); uses epoll or can be blocking with a time out.
			- Each 'node' (and there may be one per thread) sends messages
			- Messages are symmetrically encrypted with a key or uses a modern libsodium packet; they may have a key identifier to make life easier.
			- Messages have a namespace - essentially, our cluster name.
			- There is a dedicated Multicast DNS thread which maintains an up-to-date map
			- We should consider a logical => physical mapping for address and memory
